During the 16th of May, I attended a session by Microsoft intended to aid us in developing our portfolio. I learnt about the neccessity towards developing my github portfolio and how to buid a resume with a simple website template they provided. I was able to start working on my resume during the session. They taught us how to use microsoft azure and its resources. I was able to link my azure account to my github and deploy my resume to a running website. Here's the link to the website: https://black-rock-055446b03.3.azurestaticapps.net (still in progress).
